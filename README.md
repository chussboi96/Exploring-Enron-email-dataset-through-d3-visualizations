# Exploring-Enron-email-dataset-through-d3-visualizations
This Data Analysis&Visualization semester project revolved around creating interactive d3.js visualizations. 
I created sunburst, tree, scatterplot, wordcloud and force-directed graphs using the code on observable d3.js
Although the viz werent interactive and brushing/linking wasnt applied, it was something.
I implemented LSA, NER and topic modelling to visualize the insights.
